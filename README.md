Silly PHP Framework
===================

Silly is a lightweight PHP framework that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It was inspired by the popular CakePHP framework and aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for developing web applications.

With Silly, you can quickly build and deploy PHP applications that are organized and easy to maintain. Its modular architecture allows you to add or remove features as needed, while keeping the core of your application intact.

One of the key features of Silly is its focus on simplicity. The framework provides a clean and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to write and understand code. This means that you can spend more time developing your application and less time figuring out how the framework works.

Despite its lightweight design, Silly still includes many of the features you would expect from a modern PHP framework. These include:

Routing: Easily map URLs to controller actions
Views: Templating engine that separates HTML from PHP logic
Models: Abstraction layer for working with databases
Helpers: A collection of utility functions for common tasks

Whether you're building a small website or a complex web application, Silly is a great choice for developers who want a simple and efficient PHP framework.
